<p><img src="images/14246962137_522ef0d4dc_o.jpg" alt="Battle Bus" height="700px" width="650px"> Now I know that this bus doesnt seem like much but if I got the bus I woukd deck it out and make it look amazing and I would be able to live in it or drive all my friends around after I customize it and make it look so good. The reason I want this bus is because it would be so cool if I had a whole bus and like I said I could drive all my friends around and deck it out to make it look amazing.</p>
