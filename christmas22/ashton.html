	<h1> Ashton John-Paul Charter </h1>
	<p><img src="images/thumbnail_IMG_8718.jpeg" alt="ashton charter" widht="50000px" height="900px"> Aston charter is one of the items on my list. A very unreasonable request seeing as hes a human and you cant really own humans but its ashton. In order for santa to wrap ashton up hes gonna need a lot if not all his wrapping paper. In the ashton deluxe bundle it comes with ashton, aphrodite, don and kayla, jaden waite, and overwatch 2 grindkit. the reaason i want ashton as a gift is because hell help me grind out overwatch and make me peanut butter and fluffs constantly.</p>
	
	<p>Ashton will go into my house and have his own room in the house and fit perfectly. He'll be bathed, fed, and cared for. Ashton will be able to do weekly grocery runs since he'll probably eat all the groceries in my house anyways and he'll enjoy staying in my house more than his own because his brother and sister-in law wont leave him home alone randomly so he wont have a reason to come to the xbox party and be like "okay so basically..."</p>
