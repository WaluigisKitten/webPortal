<h1>MANGO MAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</h1>
	<p><img src="images/thumbnail_IMG_0096.jpeg" alt="mason goolden" height="700px" width="650px">The biggest item on my list and the hardest to achieve is Mango May. This man is an absolute unit of a human being, a 10 man army, and the greatest rapper alive. Mason has made many appearances in the world with his most famous one being "meat" or at least thats what people called him when he dressed up as rapper Yeat. The reason I want mason as a gift is because hes very funny and lovable and would make a great addition to the kids I own.</p>
	<h3>Price: 2.5 Million dollars</h3>
